### Visual style

This project has drawn inspiration from the visual style and certain graphic elements of [Enlightenment](https://www.enlightenment.org/), a Window Manager, Compositor, and Minimal Desktop for Linux and other compatible UNIX systems. Their distinctive design has greatly influenced the aesthetics of this project, and I wish to express my profound appreciation for their innovative work.

Any modifications or adaptations made to the original graphics and styles are my responsibility. All rights, acknowledgments, and credits for the original design elements belong to the Enlightenment project and its contributors.

To explore more about Enlightenment and their contributions to the open-source community, please visit the [official Enlightenment website](https://www.enlightenment.org/).

### Icons

Most icons were taken from [Lyra Icon Theme](https://github.com/yeyushengfan258/Lyra-icon-theme/tree/master/src), a beautiful icon theme for Linux desktops.

Several icons used in this project were adapted from icons sourced from [svgrepo](https://www.svgrepo.com/).
