## Documentation

For those with technical curiosities, here are some goodies to browse through:
- This application was written following Clean Architecture and Domain Driven Design. Although you've probably seen it countless times before, here is the diagram of how the structure looks like.
- A tree-like schematic of the Lumina's Server Domain layer can be seen [here](./docs/technical/domain/Domain.md).
- The Ubiquitous Language used by Lumina's Server Domain layer can be read [here](./docs/technical/domain/UbiquitousLanguage.md).
- For Software Architects, the architecture documents of Lumina were designed using the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/), therefor, you can visualize:
1. [1 System Context diagram](./docs/technical/architecture/1%20system-context-diagram.svg)
2. [2 Container diagram](./docs/technical/architecture/2%20container-diagram.svg)
3. [3.1 Component Web Client diagram](./docs/technical/architecture/3.1%20component-web-client-diagram.svg)
4. [3.2 Component API Server diagram](./docs/technical/architecture/3.2%20component-api-server-diagram.svg)
5. [4.1 Code media library scanning diagram](./docs/technical/architecture/4.1%20code-media-library-scanning-diagram.svg)
- Also for Software Architects, you might want to take a look at the Architecture Decision Log, where you may find important stories from the past of Lumina's development, like [this one](./docs/technical/architecture/architecture-knowledge-management/architecture-decision-log/architecture-decission-record-0001.md), and others like it.

### Visual style

This project has drawn inspiration from the visual style and certain graphic elements of [Enlightenment](https://www.enlightenment.org/), a Window Manager, Compositor, and Minimal Desktop for Linux and other compatible UNIX systems. Their distinctive design has greatly influenced the aesthetics of this project, and I wish to express my profound appreciation for their innovative work.

Any modifications or adaptations made to the original graphics and styles are my responsibility. All rights, acknowledgments, and credits for the original design elements belong to the Enlightenment project and its contributors.

To explore more about Enlightenment and their contributions to the open-source community, please visit the [official Enlightenment website](https://www.enlightenment.org/).

### Icons

Most icons were taken from [Lyra Icon Theme](https://github.com/yeyushengfan258/Lyra-icon-theme/tree/master/src), a beautiful icon theme for Linux desktops.

Several icons used in this project were adapted from icons sourced from [svgrepo](https://www.svgrepo.com/).
